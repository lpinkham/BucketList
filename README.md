# Bucket List App

Bucket List App is a single page application that a user can login and add items
to their bucket list. Once you have completed an item just check it off as
completed.

## Installation

1.  [Download](https://github.com/lpinkham/BucketList-Express) this repo.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1.  Ensure that you have `nodemon` installed by running `npm install -g nodemon`.
1.  Ensure the API is functioning properly by running `npm run server`.

## Tasks

Instead of `grunt`, this template uses `npm` as a task runner. This is more
conventional for modern Express apps, and it's handy because we'll definitely
use `npm` anyway. These are the commands available:

| Command                | Effect                                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run server`       | Starts a development server with `nodemon` that automatically refreshes when you change something.                                                                                         |
| `npm test`             | Runs automated tests.                                                                                       |
| `npm run debug-server` | Starts the server in debug mode, which will print lots of extra info about what's happening inside the app. |

## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`curl-scripts`](curl-scripts) to test built-in actions.
Add your own scripts to test your custom API.
